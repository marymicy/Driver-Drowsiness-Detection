# Drowsiness-Detection

Drowsiness Detection is a Python-based safety system designed to detect signs of driver fatigue and prevent road accidents. Using computer vision and deep learning, the system analyzes eye movements, blink rate, and facial expressions through a real-time video feed. It employs OpenCV for image processing, Dlib or MediaPipe for facial landmark detection, and deep learning models like CNNs to classify drowsiness levels. If signs of fatigue are detected, the system triggers an alert (such as a sound or vibration) to wake the driver. This project is ideal for students learning machine learning, image processing, and real-time safety applications, and can be integrated into advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) to enhance road safety.
